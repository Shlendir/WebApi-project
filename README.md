## WebAPI project for school.
<JavaScript, EJS, CSS>

- I used fetch from [--]
- The API lists the next retrogrades for planets and celestial bodies as JSON.
- It shows per planet if one is starting tomorrow, starting on the same day, is going on or is ending. Uses current UTC Date. Written in JS.
- Site is a simple EJS/CSS table.
- I had *fun* finding out js needs .getTime() per "if" or it's a Patrick not-my-wallet meme. (same date isn't the same date)
