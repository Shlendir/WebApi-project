## WebAPI project for school.
<JavaScript, EJS, CSS>

- I used fetch from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).
- I built my own JSON file to use it in my Discord bot in the future.
- The fetched JSON file has the next retrogrades for planets and celestial bodies.
- It shows per planet if one is starting tomorrow, starting on the same day, is going on or is ending. Uses current UTC Date. Written in JS.
- The webpage is a simple EJS/CSS table.
- I had *fun* finding out js needs .getTime() per "if" or it's a Patrick not-my-wallet meme. (same date isn't the same date :'] )
